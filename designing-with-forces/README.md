### Glossary of Terms:

- __Force__: An external drive or influence that affects an entity or another force. Forces always exist in tension with other forces, and may be *active* or *reactive*.
- __Active Force__: A force that takes something as its object. For example, a feeling, or a practice.
- __Reactive Force__: A force that is made to be the object of something else. In other words, a state or condition that is caused and controlled by another active force.
