# Another Green World?
An experiment in open writing and open process.

---

I have no idea what I'm doing, but this repo should be documenting my processes. It's starting out as open writing, trying to see what impact open-sourciness can have on my writing and thinking by writing and thinking in the open.

It may eventually transform into a design-related experiment or be forked off into something tangential. For now, it's just a space for things to go and breathe.
