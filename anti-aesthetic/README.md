# Anti-Aesthetic

What is an anti-aesthetic? What might it mean, and what might it do for us?

---

First, we should make a distinction between the *aesthetic* itself, and the *values* that hold the aesthetic together.

Any aesthetic is a visual *rendering* of a certain set of values or ideological beliefs that have *sublimated* so as to become invisible to the viewer. (The practices of critical design, design criticism, and art criticism, are uniquely positioned and able to solidify and etiologize these sublimated values).

## Working outline for an anti-aesthetic:
1. Recognize the essential
2. Strip the inessential
3. Challenge fundamental assumptions
4. Embrace aesthetic pragmatism
5. Reject aesthetic objectivity
6. Assert aesthetic freedom

## Working outline of *values* for an anti-aesthetic:
1. Ethics are essential.
2. Transparency can bring clarity, but can also obscure.
3. Aesthetics are political.
4. Everything is a force in conflict with other forces.
5. Everything is valuable.
6. Nothing is prohibited.
