# Anti-Aesthetic

What is an anti-aesthetic? What might it mean, and what might it do for us?

---

First, we should make a distinction between the *aesthetic* itself, and the *values* that hold the aesthetic together.

Any aesthetic is a visual *rendering* of a certain set of values or ideological beliefs that have *sublimated* so as to become invisible to the viewer. (The practices of critical design, design criticism, and art criticism, are uniquely positioned and able to solidify and etiologize these sublimated values).

## Working outline for an anti-aesthetic:
1. Recognize the essential
2. Strip the inessential
3. Challenge fundamental assumptions
4. Embrace aesthetic pragmatism
5. Reject aesthetic objectivity
6. Assert aesthetic freedom

## Working outline of *values* for an anti-aesthetic:
1. Ethics are essential.
2. Transparency can bring clarity, but can also obscure.
3. Aesthetics are political.
4. Everything is a force in conflict with other forces.
5. Everything is valuable.
6. Nothing is prohibited.

## Why do we need an anti-aesthetic?

To get at the real answer to this question, let's start from the beginning: What is an aesthetic? At its most formal level, an aesthetic is a set of values imposed on a work in order to define its visual form. These values tend, more often than not, to be limited to the realm of *taste*, which can be viewed as an immediate and egoistically disinterested reaction: "this is beautiful" or "this is ugly." This conception of aesthetics runs deep through the world of design; but it is oversimplified and ignores the real etiology of a given aesthetic, which is *ideology*.

Any given aesthetic is a *rendering*. By this I mean that the aesthetic forms created by the author of a work are crystallized, formal projections of some notion, value, or interaction of forces that gave rise to the problem a work seeks to solve, or to the void a work seeks to fill. But there are two types of values that an aesthetic renders, and most discussions of beauty and effectiveness in design ignore the most fundamental. As stated previously, these two categories of values are *aesthetic* values, which pertain to immediate taste, and *ideological* values, which pertain to a particular worldview and political standpoint.

What is important to note before moving forward is that the ideological values *give birth* to the aesthetic values, which in turn gives birth to aesthetic form.
